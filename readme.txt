== Description ==

Dragging and dropping widgets into sidebars can be tricky. This plugin lets you click a widget, and then choose where it should be placed. Simple. Easy.

Note: This plugin assumes you have [MP6](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/) installed and activated. Without MP6, things may look wonky.

== Installation ==

Install this plugin just like any normal WordPress plugin, by dropping the folder into your wp-content/plugins/ folder. Once you activate the plugin, just click on a widget and a dialog will display asking you where you'd like to place your widget.

Replaced the select with a list of sidebars. Cleaned up the javascript and squashed a few bugs with the help of the great azaozz. Now, when you choose a sidebar, it will open and highlight the new widget.

= 0.2 =
You can add widgets to open widget areas, and it should save. Otherwise, you're out of luck.

Starting development with a concept UI. Nothing actually works, yet.
